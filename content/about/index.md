<b>2018 / 2021</b><br><br>
These 3 years of computer science degree allowed me to really master programming languages like Java and C++. I was also able to discover databases (SQL, PostgreSQL) and web programming with PHP, HTML and CSS. Finally, I studied low-level computer science with computer architecture and operating systems.
